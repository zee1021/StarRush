# StarRush
Python Game Project
Our project is about a python game based on the Japan classic game called "Sokoban" from the late 80's.
We've added a bit twist on it which is the graphics and a bit of the gameplay.
The goal of the game is simple, you just have to move the character to push the stars to its destined base before going to the next level.
Our project comes in handy for other python game developers for them to have useful reference if they ever
though of creating a game like Sokoban.
Each command in our program also explains how it functions for them to understand it well on how the game works.
Our project isn't possible without the help and contribution of my co members whom are:
Suzzane (Me)  - programmer
Emery - game analyst
Francess and Zyra - researchers
